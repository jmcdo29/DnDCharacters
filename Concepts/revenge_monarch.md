Okay, so character concept: a noble, or even child of a monarch, in line for the
throne. They grew up around the castle with a best friend and on the day of
their coronation, the ceremony was interrupted, the current monarchs are killed,
and the character flees, but is assumed dead. The best friend, who was second in
line, assumes the throne and slanders the name of the character and the late
monarchs. Word gets to the character eventually, and they sell their
soul/life/will/etc to a warlock patron in return for the ability to reclaim
what's rightfully theirs.

Important notes of the character:

- grew up very kind and rather religious, blessed be the light, etc
- at the time of learning the news, has a major character shift and leans much
  more to chaotic neutral, maybe even evil
  - very much out for revenge at just about any cost
  - very much becomes the villain of the best friend's story
  - Patron may have even said "You're always gonna be the villain of someone
    else's story. That's really their fault for pissing you off in the first
    place"
- before the betrayal, the character had a love of the best friend, and shared
  lessons and even castle/palace/family secrets with them.
  - Gave them everything just to be betrayed
- if you're scared of my bark, you'll be scared of my bite
- End goal is to reassume the throne.
  - Does not necessarily mean a change of heart once there. Could still be
    coldly just, if not a bit sadistic

Things I'm unsure of:

- could I actually keep up the villain vibes for a campaign
- would this ever fit in Unteris, or would I need to play them in a different
  world/DM (I know evil campaigns aren't something you'd really want to run, nor
  corrupt politics)
- if Unteris, which patron?
  - Klinge Seele could be cool for Hexblade, but not sure if she's fully up for
    revenge plot
  - Unseelie Archfey? Ciaradh or Queen Eira?
  - Fiend?
- race
