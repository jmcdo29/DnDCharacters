* Alodan decided to oversleep // Meelo was late
* About 5 hours until the water breathing spell wears off
* Urshire is all tatted up, and I ordered bubble shots for the table
* We are calling ourselves \_\_"The Identity Crisis"\_\_
* Kaikanea (guard?) gave us book (note?) about Nympha
* Alodan \_pretty much\_ has to go to the tournament of genasi so we can talk to Malak
* \_\_\*\*\_this is gonna suck\_\*\*\_\_
* Nyreena is taking us back to the surface around Golmars
* Made it to Golmars after walkling for a bit
* There are no guards, the gates are unlocked
* There's like \_\_no one\_\_ around in the town
* Fountains are terribly poisoned (all fresh water it seems)
* Masks for all (except Old Spice)
* Headed to the castle
* Very fast spreading disease effecting Golmars
* Princess Briar sits on the thrown, something isn't right here
* City water comes from Lagonna de Gemmes
* Somehow Princess Briar doens't have the disease. Maybe not drinknig water enough? Maybe good (bad?) luck
* Royal Children: Sebastian, Briar, Ella, Lilabelle
* Old Spice doing good work to heal royal family as well as possible
* We're gonna head to Lagonna de Gemmes and try to find the source
* This \_might\_ be due to Nympha (the bitch)
* Urshire collected some water samples
* He and Ari are apparently gonna try to make a remedy from it. I really wish them the best with this, it's all over my head
* The magic protection house is cool as hell
* We \*\*keep\*\* \_fucking\_ saying "Magic is real."
* Old Spice \_somehow\_ carved our names into our beds while we slept (how the fuck??)
* Ration breakfast!
* Into the Lagoon we go
* \_\_It smells \*\*fucking\*\* awful\_\_
* Fish scale/butterfly medium sized \_things\_ (same colors as Nympha) :butterfly:
* Just a reminder to myself \*\*we are not a quiet group\*\*
* The scale thingies attack
* Alodan lauched a fucking \_fireball\_ :fire:
* Took them out pretty handily :crossed_swords:
* Alodan fell in the water :nauseated_face:
* Lots more scales
* Found a voice that \_basically\_ admitted to poisoning the town. Put here by his "mother"
* What in the unholy fuck is that?
* There are \*\*entierly\*\* too many scale butterfly fuckers
* We...we fucking did it? 
* \_\_\*\*WE FUCKING DID IT!!!\*\*\_\_
