Dear diary,

My head really hurt this morning, and everything was suuuuper loud. Rhage had a
great idea though and I was able to purge whatever demon was in my stomach.
Solei was having to deal with being hungover as the others called it though.

WE went shopping in the morning and Burning Sails found us after we went to the
market asking us to help out with an issue. Turns out, he wanted to bet on a
fight at some sort of club, and Rhage stepped up and took on the champion of ten
years, and she ended up winning! Ah gods it was so cool, she was such a badass
fighter!! Pierre the Black fell in the ring at her hand! Oh I wish I could
describe just how amazing she was in the fight.

Burning Sails was super happy about the win, apparently he owed money to the
Fiend's Chosen. Awkward. Rhage was able to get some explosive goo stuff from
Burning Sails as the favor that he owed us, so we could get into the collapsed
tunnels that the Sol is hiding in.

When we came back to the inn, Rhage, Lucacul, and Hamble went to the baths
again. I went to the kitchen though, and convinced the cook to let me make some
dinner and treats for everyone to celebrate Rhage's win! I'm almost in disbelief
that I was able to talk my way in, but I guess I said the right things.
