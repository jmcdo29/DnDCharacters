Dear diary,

We went to the beach! Seems I'm the only one who's enjoyed a beach before. But,
I was able to show Rhage, Hamble, and Kassian how much fun it is to splash
around in the water. Kassian and I played volleyball while Hamble and Rhage
buried Beau in the sand. Then we heard these really loud footsteps, which turned
out to be the spirit of the forest, Thicket. Oh! We got swimsuits from Fish and
Barrel too.

Thicket told us that there were some spirits of the water? that he had a bit of
a dispute with, who then showed up and we had to "fight"? them to help settle
the disagreement. I ended up arm-wrestling Kyle, who had a robotic arm, Kassian
surfed against Axel, who had a strangely long nose, Rhage lifted weights against
Squaticles, and Hamble eventually performed against Brosiden, and Hamble did
such an amazing job with the performance! It was so incredible!! Oh! And Hamble
ended up kissing Rhage, which was cute.

Brosiden was really upset that they lost every competition, so he attacked us.
It was honestly a pretty easy fight, but they did have some ways to hurt us in
the head which didn't feel good at all. And after we defeated him and his crew,
he tried to come back at us in a much larger form and then his dad showed up and
called him Timothy.

Beau and I built a sandcastle. Hamble and Rhage built one too, but ours was
slightly better.
