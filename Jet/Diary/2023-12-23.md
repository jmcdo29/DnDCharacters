Dear diary,

We safely left Burning Sails's island and made it back to the mainland, heading
straight for Fabian "The Succubus" Dread. I didn't realize he'd be related to
Father Dread until Rhage pointed that out to me! On the trip to the mountains
south east of Dorran, I got to talk to Rhage and she eventually asked why I want
to be a hero, a legend so much. She also asked if when the last time I talked
with my parents, even by letter was. I guess it's been about 3 or 4 years. We,
well, I guess we really haven't talked when I left. I will try to be less
positive and more warm like Rhage had mentioned... Gotta figure out how to do
that first!

During watch, I heard Ivory's voice... I heard his taunts. _the entry abruptly
stops there_
