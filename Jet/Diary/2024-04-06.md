Dear diary,

- made it to the expedition group
  - Jonah and Allias Magnus
  - Jonah mentioned shifter and other nomadic tribes going missing
- Into the Wilds we go!
  - feel a little alien
  - Allias asked for all of our names
    - traveling with Richard, John, and Peter
  - be cautious about what all we hear
    - the fey magics seem to play tricks
    - "The heroes rest at the Carnelian"
      - safe phrase to snap out of things
