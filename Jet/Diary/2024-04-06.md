Dear diary,

Elias

We safely made it to the Magnus Wilds Expedition Group's camp and met Jonah and
Allias Magnus. Jonah was super excited to meet us and was incredibly helpful and
nice to talk with. Allias was a bit more abrasive and seemed to be more
concerned about exploring the wilds and making a profit off of the expedition.
After talking with everyone for a bit, we went into the wilds. It felt really
strange in there, like a whole different world, and I couldn't feel Deadrian's
light near as well as I usually can. Allias asked everyone in the group our
names, and we were told to be incredibly cautious about what we heard cause fey
like to play tricks. We came up with the code phrase "The heroes rest at the
Carnelian" as a way to help us regain our senses in case things went wrong. And
then this little shifter boy came out of the woods asking for help. As I moved
towards him Allias told me to stop, and he turned into this monstrous thing that
attacked us.
