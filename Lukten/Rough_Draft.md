2 A rival, who's an equal (Someone who sees you as an antagonist to their own story. and stands as a peer.): Brask Turvden, a fellow monk at the Tonsburg monastery who was considered a star student.

What is something not connected to your personal quest that your character is interested in?

Lukten wants to rid Drakkenheim of the Haze and help restore the city to order. His family may be gone, but he has not forgotten his home.


Backstory

Lukten grew up in a working family, having needs provided for in a comfortable environment, living in the city of Drakkenheim. That changed when the meteor hit. When Lukten learned about Lucretia Mathias's prohphecy of the return of the meteor he begged his family to leave the city to find a new home, but they refused. Lukten went off on his own and started to make his own life in Tonsberg as a monk. The week of the meteor Lukten returned to his family to make one final plea for them to listen to the warning from Lucretia, but they still would not listen. The night he left, the meteor struck. His family and home did not make it. With no family to return to, stricken with grief, he made his way back to Tonsburg. On his way, a piece of the meteor broke off and landed on the road in front of him. When he drew near to investigate it, he could feel the magical power of the meteor coursing through the air and into him. After a few moments of intense heat and searing pain, the feeling subsided, and when Lukten looked at his skin he saw it was ashen in color and his veins and hair glowed like a purple fire.

As the profecy of Lucretia Mathias did indeed come to pass, Lukten puts a lot of trust into her words, and believes she was unfairly excommunicated. Part of his reason for returning to Drakkenheim is to thank her for her warning and offer to take place in whatever may come, against what dark forces may threaten the realm.


Personal Question

Personal Pilgrimage. As an acolyte of the faith, my personal  quest is to visit several holy places in the city and perform a sacred ritual before the remains of the martyrs interred within each: the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio, Saint Selinaâ€™s Monastery, and the Chapel in Castle Drakken. Through these devoted acts I will  understand my place in the divine order. 


Features

Feature: Guided by Faith
A number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus, you may ask the Game Master to reveal the DC of any ability check you make before rolling the dice. You may then decide whether or not you wish to attempt the roll. 

Ki Save = 8 + prof + wis mod

Flurry of Blows.
Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.

Patient Defense.
You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.

Step of the Wind.
You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

Deflect Missiles
Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with a range of 20/60 using the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.


Ki-Fueled Attack (Optional)
Also at 3rd level, if you spend 1 ki point or more as part of your action on your turn, you can make one attack with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon as a bonus action before the end of the turn.

Background

Variant Devoted Missionary: Stargazer
You witnessed the meteor 15 years ago. Whether you believe it to be destiny, a magical or divine calling, or just curiosity of the secrets that need to be unearthed, you are drawn to the crater. You believe that the crater holds some answers to the questions you seek, and that somewhere in Drakkenheim lies a truth beyond your comprehension. Your pilgrimage to Drakkenheim may have taken you weeks, months or even years but you had to come - something called you here and you must discover its origin.
