Evie showed up seemingly out of nowhere, claimed she got lost on the way to the
inn, but hey, she's here now, so that's great. Dagmar patched us all up as best
she could, and we headed further into the rats' nest to try to find this crystal
and Petra. We moved around as quietly as we could, but ended up running into an
occupied nest. The ratling was wary of us, guarding his nest, but Dagmar offered
a couple of gold pieces and Kisa offered it a ration and without trouble we were
able to keep moving on. The tunnel we were directly in ran into a dead end
though, so we had to backtrack on our way out. On our way out of that tunnel, an
arrow thudded into the wall close to Dagmar, who mentioned that we didn't need
to fight and that we could give them some shinies.

Well, this seems to have been a big mistake as ratlings appear all around us
clamoring about the shinies. It felt like there were at least ten or fifteen of
them around us, firing from all directions in these tight tunnels. I head down
one of the nearby tunnels where a rock hit me from and cave one ratling's face
in as I then try for another, but end up missing, and it got a bite on me
instead. They just keep coming and piling on, and before I know it, I'm gasping
on the ground. The last thing I felt was an incredible heat, and then everything
went cold and dark.
