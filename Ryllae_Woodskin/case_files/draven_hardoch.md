# Draven Hardoch

* Start Date: 5th of Soli, 1368
* End Date: 13th of Soli, 1368

## Objective

Determine the cause of the disappearance of Molly Hardoch, Mr Hardoch's 19 year old daughter.

## Case Notes

Notes are kept in a separate file as the details are a very sensitive topic.

### Invoice

| Line Item | Quantity | Price | Total |

### Personal Notes

Next time, with sensitive topics, maybe word the outcome more gently. I don't think I'll be getting Mr. Hardoch's business again.
