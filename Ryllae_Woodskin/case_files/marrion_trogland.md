# Marrion Trogland

- Start Date: 1st of Cresco, 1369
- End Date: 40th of Cresco, 1369

## Objective

Determine why pets are going missing. Marrion has lost 5 pets in the past two weeks and would like them back if possible.

## Case Notes

This was a tricky one, and took _way_ longer than I thought it would. Marrion owned a whole slew of pets, exotic and mundane, and there seemed to be no correlation between those taken. I ended up in some very seedy parts of town, near the sewer ways on market street far from the castle when I got my first clue a week into the investigation. Long days searching up and down town just to come up with nothing was taking its toll, but finally a clue: an odd tuft of fur and a few scales.

The sewer ways were a labyrinth to traverse, especially ith making as little noise as possible, I had to leave myself clues as I kept going to make it further each day until finally I found some sort of meeting place. I must've taken way too many wrong turns to finally find the place.

As it turns out, there was some sort of fighting ring down here that an organization was using. I had to observe for a few nights before I noticed that each night it was mostly the same animals fighting with a few new ones every couple of days. Retrieving the animals directly was out of my ability, but I was able to go to Abigail Nighthawk and ask for the guards' assistance in the bust of the fighting ring.

With their help, I was able to retrieve Marrion's pets and return them safe and sound, or as sound as they could be after missing for a month.
