# Trisha Fireheart

## Objective

Find my lost silver locket.

## Case Notes

Pretty standard case here, asked about the last known location of the locket, where she wore it out, and looked in the areas. Finally found it in an oddity shop and was able to inform Trisha of its location. Whoever sold it probably made a small earning on it.
