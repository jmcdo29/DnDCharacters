# Connections

## An authority figure

Lieutenant Abigail Nighthawk of Keyguard. She caught him snooping around a restricted area while trying to solve a case. She let him off with a warning, but said next time would be a night in custody. She keeps me from doing a lot of stupid shit sometimes

## A Mentor, like a teacher

Quilgon Featherhat, gnome librarian who taught Ryllae the secrets to the library system and helped him find some specific lore around elves

## A friend, who's an equal

Garner Leahollow, halfling childhood friend who grew up teaching Ryllae about the Halfling language while they practiced archery

## A rival, who's an equal

Ignis Volnovus, Earth Genasi and founder of The Hard Truth, an investigator service a few doors down from The Woods Eye, uses a crossbow instead of a bow and arrow and has occasional one-upping and drinking competitions with Ryllae

## Someone you helped

Old Lady Acana, human late 60s, helped get her son out of a gambling ring as one of my first investigations (also where I met Lt Nighthawk)

## Someone who helped you

The Brickenrest family in Prismaglen, they allowed me to spend a few nights in their home and have a few hot meals on my way from Ebonwood to Keyguard, asking for nothing but company in return.

## Someone you hurt

Mr. Draven Hardoch, human late 40s, he asked me to look into the disappearance of his daughter. True to my own nature, I told him the truth that I found, that she had been kidnapped and used by a group of bandits until they disposed of her. He was not too keen to hear that information. Maybe I should have told him in a different manner?

## Someone who hurt you

The entire Blue Fox Tavern in Foxvale. The bartender noticed my pointed ears and asked my clan and age. When I informed him that I was unaware of my heritage other than the generalities and that I was around 28 he laughed calling me such a baby and that I had a lot of growing up left to do, then made it a point to point me out to every coworker he could until every patron in the tavern that evening knew who I was. I've never felt so humiliated for something I can't control. 

# Motivations

## Whatâ€™s your motivation? 

### Long term. 6 months to a year

Find specific information on the elf tribe he's from and meeting them the truth must be known to him. Also, buy a house, living in an inn for the rest of my life does not sound like the most fun thing ever. Sure, it's great for a few weeks, maybe a few months, but eventually the continuous smell of ale and rowdy crowd get to you.

### Short term. 1 week to a month

Earn enough money to help Garner move away from Ebonwood, he doesn't want his best friend living in a small town when he knows what all is waiting in Keyguard.
