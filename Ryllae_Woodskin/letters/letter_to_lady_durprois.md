Lady Durprois,

My sincerest apologies for the tardiness of my response. Please rest assured
that taking care of the problems of the citizens of Keygarde is the top priority
of The Wood's Eye Investigators. I have been away on business with some new
prospects, uncovering secrets of a mystery that may very well be the enigma of a
lifetime, and I simply could not pass up the opportunity to delve further into
what puzzles this conundrum holds.

Trust that I am on my way back to Keygarde, and should be be within a fortnight
to begin my investigation to your freezing bathwater posthaste. I greatly
appreciate your patience and understanding, and guarantee that this difficulty
you've been facing will be dealt with.

Best regards,

Ryllae Woodskin

Wood's Eye Investigator
