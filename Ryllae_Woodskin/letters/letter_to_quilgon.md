Dear Quilgon,

Apologies that it's been a while since I've been to the library, the steady stream of mundane jobs has kept me busy without the need to dig too deep as of late. However, something has come up and I require some assistance from you, if you have the resources to spare of course.

I recently attended a harvest festival in Shadewick and woke up in some sort of cellar with a couple of other people, somewhere in the Starwood forest. Now, normally that would be strange enough to warrant some of my time, but more pressing information has come out of this adventure already: my new companions and I all seem to have a green gem embedded into our body somewhere, and we found some notes on the gems. It would appear that these gems originate in Vistem and either in some sort of mine deep underneath Keygarde that I've never been aware of, or in a mine in the Moonvalley mountains. I've drawn a rough sketch of the gems, they glow a sickly green color, and apparently can be made of use in a liquid form as well. Most of this I didn't even realize was possible until reading through some of these notes.

If you have the time, any information that you or your seemingly all-knowing network can pass on about this would be great. I'll be to Keygarde in a day or two.

Best regards,
Ryllae Woodskin
Detective of the Wood's Eye
