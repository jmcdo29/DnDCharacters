Miss Xiloscient,

I wanted to thank you for the picture of my parents and the information
pertaining to our clan, what little may be left of it. As it turns out, I may
have met someone who can help me understand more about our origins. Any
information I can pass on I will.

Speaking of which, I know I'm just a child who you barely just met, but I
wanted to give you a warning about one of your researchers: Gemflower. It seems
that he's involved with a group known as The Ballad of the Champions, and it's
not the kind of group you probably eventually want associated with UMA. One of
my companions got the information from another member of the same group, Irena,
though she belonged to a different sect than the one Gemflower belongs to. 

This group believes that they are a group of superior races and that "filthy"
races have stolen their birthright of power. In the city, they've attacked
Alastor, the jeweler, and in the past they've attacked another companion of
mine, a Syren. I hesitate to say much more about their goals in case there is
someone somehow reading in on this.

I understand this accusation is heavy and without any hard proof it's hard to
take my word, but I wanted to inform you as soon as possible.

Arvita keep you safe,
Bryn
