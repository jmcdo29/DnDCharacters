We find our party drinking at The Last Drop, after a rough day of touring the city, tracking a woman who has done Zerrias wrong, and tearing apart Ryllae's room at The Wood's Eye. The group drank and ate, enjoying the Cherry Fire the tavern offered along with some fine dragon steaks and soup.

After taking a few shots, Zerrias opened up about why he was tracking this woman down and what she had done to him and his husband, Simon, with the help of his family, whom he was also tracking. In a bit of stunned silence, everyone except for E.V.E tried to give some condolences of some sort while offering to help Zerrias to the best of their extent.

Zerrias was informed as well that the invitations he and Ryllae were carrying probably had a scrying spell on them and immediately pulled his out to set it aflame and get rid of it. In doing so, he set off the magic alarm system in the tavern and Cassius, the owner of the establishment, came over to see what happened. After Ryllae explained the situation, Cassius let the group off with a warning mentioning they should warn him next time they're gonna pull a stunt like that. In the time that the system had to refresh, Ryllae had enough time to pull his invitation out and let Zerrias burn it as well.

A few shots later, Embry opened up about being from a nomadic caravan of halfling healers and being forced to leave after being caught conning a patron, being on her own since then and relying on some quick talking and sleight of hand to make a living as she traveled from town to town, never staying for too long.

Zerrias got rooms for the party, as staying at The Last Drop was his doing, and decided to bunk with Maxam and E.V.E through the night, getting a discount as Embry pulled her famous "my leg" shtick again and the tavern keeper just wanted the party to be quite. Ryllae waited outside to avoid the noise, and to avoid any more unwanted attention from the owners.

Once back inside, Zerrias gave Ryllae the key to the room for him and Embry, and E.V.E obliged Ryllae's request to carry Embry to her bed, as inebriated as she was. The night was quiet, but in the morning Ryllae awoke to find a different roommate than the one he fell asleep with, a small fox with fur the color of a merlot.

The party got their breakfast and Ryllae noticed Quilgon and Pense eating as well, who he then went to go talk with. No new news about the gems or journal, but to his surprise Zerrias and Embry both came as well to hear the conversation.

After breakfast the party headed to The Wood's Eye to clean up the upper floor and strategize about how they would go about the waterways in search of Adalaine.
