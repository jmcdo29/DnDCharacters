(From DM (GM)): (BOTW Memory Moment) You hear a woman's voice. She sounds scared, frightened and out of breath. "Please, Arvita, Priestess of the Vitoak, please let him live."
(To GM): can I roll a history check about the Vitoak?
(From DM (GM)): Yes
(To GM): see if this gives me similar vibes from what I've read :)
(From Orb Ponderer): Eve taps on your shoulder and hands you a piece of paper that says "Vitarta, Twisted Princess, Birth of Vichor" written in her blood. bottom of the paper shows a drawing of the gem they got out of the wall.
Ryllae Woodskin:(To GM)rolling => 11
(To Orb Ponderer): Ryllae will take the note and look at it with confusion
(From DM (GM)): The Vitoak, or the Life Tree, is the massive tree that floats above Unteris. directly above Keygarde. It is said to be the origin of all Life.
(To GM): So no clue if this _could_ be the same root, yeah?
(From DM (GM)): Speculation at best. But it is possible
