    * Sir Pense is **not** working with Adalaine, _phew_
* I got some Chimera's Blood Mead for Pense
  * He's forgiven us
  * A's group was after Pense cause he's a Naga
    * Naga's have an old direct connection to Arvita and Vitarta

  * Zerrias left near the end in a hurry
    * Is he okay? He was leaking smoke again
    * Seems to be having another vision
      * Crazy ass imagery in these things
        * Some woman, the Vitoak, split wide open mouth?
* Embry figured out Zerrias is in a magical contract
* Embry mentioned there may be a large Naga in a forest in Viridiem
