When we resume with our party, they are just waking up from the long events of
yesterday. After some breakfast and brief interactions with each other, Embry decides
she will wait at The Wood's Eye with Zerrias while the rest of the group goes to
question the UMA division in Keygarde. After Embry leaves waiting for the supplies
to Zerrias, Zerrias joins the rest of the group to visit UMA. Once there, Ryllae
speaks with the receptionist and acquires access to Ambition's office to ask him
some questions. Unfortunately, it mostly ends up being a dead end, only learning that
most information on Arvita has been lost, save for some at pieces, anything on Vitarta
is nothing more than bedtime stories, and he himself has not had any interaction with
Adalaine. He did mention that one of the newly hired researchers has been writing
weekly correspondences, but wasn't able to say which one. After dropping back by
the receptionist, they learn that Raymond is probably who they are looking for, but he
is not in today, and after an unsuccessful persuasion attempt, the group leaves back
for The Wood's Eye to journey out to Golmars. 

The trip out to Golmars is uneventful for the first day, some idle chatter here and 
there as they find a place to camp just before the bridge spanning the gap between
Viridiem and Vistem. After setting up the camp, the group noticed that Zerrias
was nowhere to be found. Unbeknownst to the rest of them, Zerrias started walking
across the bridge on his own, following the pull of something familiar. Once in
Viridiem, he found himself looking at another root of the Vitoak and dealing with
a stranger, who had a familiar presence. After a slightly hostile introduction, the
two reconciled and Zerrias brought Din back to the party across the bridge.

Tensions were high as Zerrias returned with a new companion, and after a few questions
Ryllae tried to probe his mind to understand more about this new member. He was unable
to get too deep though, but was able to find out that the stranger was telling the
truth in all of his answers. Din mentioned being from Natura, the old name of Viridiem
from the children's story. Din also mentioned that he was unaware of where or what
Keygarde is, giving slight suspicion to the party, but assured everyone he was there
to help.

Later around the fire, Ryllae brought up a conversation that got lost in the original
chaos: Din airing that Zerrias was using the rest of the group as cover. In attempting
to get more information from Zerrias on this, Ryllae asked Din to repeat himself, who
instead turned the conversation on Ryllae about probing his mind earlier, and taking
away his choice to reveal that information. After some moral and philosophical discussion
Ryllae did concede that was he did was wrong, even though it was good intentioned.

Most of the rest of the night was rather peaceful, with Embry and Din playing a game
of Raven, Rat, Spider, and then Din and E.V.E. keeping watch while the party rested.
Din spent the night talking with E.V.E. and teaching her words, especially those for
love. They shared nostalgic tokens that they couldn't recall why they were nostalgic,
and in the morning E.V.E. woke the group by playing a flute that she had. Din joined
in with some song in an unknown language. Embry and Maxam both joined in with drums
to enhance the song and energize the group for the rest of the travel to Golmars.

When close to the city, Din and Zerrias fell back for a few moments to have a more
private conversation about their motives and goals in the city. Once caught back up,
Ryllae asked that Zerrias doesn't just go running off without the group again, to which
Zerrias agreed and asked for help in taking care of his family. What the day holds
from here is yet to be seen.
