* Zerrias ran off to the cabin for a while
  * Comes out of the cabin and sits right in front of Zyphie
  * Zerrias talked with Zyphie
  * Ended up pissing her off
  * Oh fuck she's infeected with Vichor
  * Zyphie grew in size as the Vichor overtook her
    * She can summon fucking dogs??
      * Vitarta damnit!
  * Zerrias! Now is not the time to be remoresful!
  * Zyphie, is she even Zyphie anymore?, can errupt in a pillar of fire
* Whoa, Din is actually talking to me about Zyphie's fate
  * Is he starting to trust me?
* We lasted in the fight, Zyphie perished at the end in Zerrias's arms
  * He's an emotional wreck now
* We swam/rode back to land
  * The ship burned :(
* Zerrias called me a half breed
  * fucker
  * I lost my temper and revealed that I'm Amanodel Clan
* Din called us out for being children
  * He's right though. I lost my temper
  * Asked me to "pay it forward" to pay back Arvita for protecting me
* Gemflower is definitely bad news
* Din wants to go after Zerrias's next two names
  * Then head after the celestials
  * Very straight to the point
  * Thinks we should be wary of the Orchids having Vichor jewelry
