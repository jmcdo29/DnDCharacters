As we arrive back at Forget Your Troubles Tavern, we find our party discussing
what the current plan is. Embry informs the group that she's going to pay her
respects to Ambrose and is ready to do whatever is necessary to be done
tomorrow. The rest of the party headed out to the mill again to examine the
zombie that was slain earlier. Din was able to notice that there were some
thorns in the body and that it seemed like the vichor got to the unfortunate
victim while they were still alive.

After examining the body, everyone made their way back to Monet's Worth Inn,
with Din arriving way before the rest of the party. He decided it would be a
good time to play a bit of a trick on his friends by buying out the rooms,
and asking the innkeeper to tell the rest of them that she doesn't sell rooms
to losers like them. When the rest of the party arrived, Embry noticed the
innkeeper and tried to hide behind the party, to which Zerrias was oblivious to
the attempt and asked her what she was doing. Ryllae walked up to the counter
and was promptly shut down, just as Din had hoped, with Ms. Monet saying "I'm
sorry, I don't sell rooms to losers.". Embry piped up that if this was about
the prank she had pulled a while ago, she could help clean things up or pay for
damages, but Ms. Monet said that wasn't necessary.

Din finally emerged from the storeroom, laughing, and said he was going to go to
sleep. Zerrias followed him upstairs, flabbergasted by the behavior, and found
Din's door to be locked. He was able to teleport into the room, where he was met
with an undressed Din getting ready to sleep. After a heated conversation, Din
was able to get Zerrias to leave the room, and had Orchid give Ryllae a key to
the other room so long as he promised to make Zerrias sleep on the floor. Embry,
in bear form, took one of the beds while Ryllae took the other. Eventually, Din
came to get Zerrias and told him to take the bed in the other room, because he
doesn't sleep and was going to go work on some druidic rituals. In the morning,
the party will be heading into the forest to investigate the demon snake after
talking with Toni about it.
