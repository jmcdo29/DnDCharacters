* Din saw some irridescant birds in the forst
  * Embry speaks with it
    * Birds are sent by Aodhan, Goddess of Fey Beasts
    * Aodhan wants us to have some sort of present
    * Vitoak root with berries
* We happened upon the lake with the "sad lady"
  * Din goes to talk while the rest of us stay back a bit
  * Din talks in an unknown language
* Giant skeletal snake showed up
  * Almost attacked Din but stopped, they exchanged words
  * Lots of vichjor things came out to attack us
  * Snake attacked vichor things too
  * Din mounted Peggy and left us...
    * Why am I not really surprised?
  * Sounds like the snake might not be fighting for us anymore...
  * Zerrias's form of dread feels and sounds different
    * Like a giant shadow snake
  * We're trying to run
    * Din, E.V.E., and Maxam made it away so far
  * I broke my bow :(
    * String snapped
  * All the tree thingies seemed to leave after Zerrias went into his dread form
    * Demon snake also stopped fighting at the sight of the form
