* E.V.E. can speak many words
	* What???
	* Now called Lucy?
	* Is not aware of who E.V.E. is in the first place
* Lucy punches Din when she meets him
	* What the actual fuck is going on??
* Din walked into the cave after he hit
	* Din healed me up
	* Black flames seemed to burn out the splinters from the needle spray
* We found some bats in the cave
	* They seem vichor infested
	* This just in, Din isn't exploring with us
		* Wonder if he's still mad about Lucy hitting him
			* Can't really say I blame him though
* I miss my bow :(
	* Din let me fucking borrow it!!
		* LET'S FUCKING GO!
* Oh boy tensions are high
	* Apparently Din keeping watch on the rear was a problem
		* Seriously?
		* This seems incredibly pedantic
* Zerrias asked to talk with Din alone
	* The rest of us went to the next cavern while they talked
