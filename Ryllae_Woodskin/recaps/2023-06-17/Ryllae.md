* Din and Zerrias came up with a marching order for us
 	* I'm near the back with Zerrias, Lucy is behind us, Din is lead
* Din let's me keep using his bow until I can restring mine
* Cleared out the first floor of the cave
	* Headed into the second floor
* Din jumped down to the third floor and made a splash
	* Lots of bats down there!
		* And a really big one
	* Provide covering from above :)
	* After taking out a few bats, Din took the weapon back
		* Went to smash the crystal in the water
* Embry is a cow
	* Somehow I'm not too surprised
* Din and Zerrias apparently talked to an old frined of Ophicius's
* There's a metal in Monstera that can apparently destroy Vichor
* It seems like Toril might be turning into Aster
* We're gonna head back to Golmars
	* Talk with Toril
	* Maybe kill Zerrias's parents
	* Head towards Monstera
		* Maybe stopping in Keygarde to help Lady Duprois
* Embry and Din apparently swapped out the leaf Zerrias got to check on his egg
	* The fake leaf crumpled immediately and burned a red color
	* Honestly, may have been a bit too far of a prank
