- Maxam and I are going to meet the Syrens
  - Gave a guy (Azreal) a fish sandwich
    - Bought 6, one for each Syren, myself, and Maxam, the one for Azreal
    - Azreal feels indebted to us after the sandwich
      - Can't seem to remember why he's in Golmars
  - Maxam went to the basement to see if Azreal can join the meeting
  - Met with Corsea and Ulakai
  - River's Tear is missing
    - Ah fuck
    - Princess Narisa has left the domain to find the Tear
    - Decent sized teardrop shaped gem on a pearl necklace
    - Maxam had a great idea to ask about side effects of the tear
  - Syrens brought a jounral with accounts from Riven
  - There has been unrest of nepositism withthe royal family
  - Corsea said Princess Narisa probably can't hold her own in the world
    - Headed out West from Koraqua
      - Koraqua spans the central region of Unteris underwater
      - wow, what a secret to keep
- Vir has a pet manta ray
  - WTF? That's so cool!
- Looks like Zerrias robbed the hell out of his parents' house
- Azreal is a worshipper of the God of Death
  - "Mother" sent him to Golmars about the "crazy" thing going on in Monstera
    - Crazy thing is the champion's orbs
- Zerrias gave me 20gold
  - Azreal tried to give me 50 for the fish sandwich from earlier
    - It was literally 5 silver! No need to give me 100 times the cost
- Zerrias needs me to do something in Din's room
  - Wonder what he needs me to do this time?
  - Needs me to pick a lockbox
    - Well, that was easy
- Azreal's father is actually Mors
  - Fucker, what?
- Licianna's family is probably okay
- Zerrias pulled out a locket and Maxam's legs turned to a tail really quickly
  - What in the actual fuck?!
  - It's made of Luna Steel
    - Forces shifters to their original form
    - Also the raw form can be used against vichor
- Zerrias's parents are getting more cult-y
  - That's just great
- Din wants to sell stuff before heading to Keygarde
  - Will probably buy spell stuff in Keygarde as well
- Got to talk with Azreal
  - Came from a temple in Monstera
  - Father is literally Mors
    - Holy fuck
  - Has heard of Syn
    - Knows about the line "Under the True Moon will he return through a gift
      from the God of Beasts"
    - the True Moon is the Last Full Moon of Winter. The Blessing of the God of
      Beasts refers to Therio, God of Beasts. There are legends that Therio
      comes to The Material Plane and offers a gift to the Moon during the True
      Moon as a means to spend time with his best friend. The area is a clifftop
      not too far south from Knightmount that houses a solitary temple to Therio
  - Told Azreal if he had any questions to just ask and I'd try to help
  - His staff can turn into an eyeball
    - Oh this guy is weird
  - I looked under his mask when waking him up
    - Pretty cute to be honest
    - I do feel kinda bad though
- Something is weird with Din
  - He's eating
  - He's smelling things
  - Didn't want to sell things this morning
  - It's not like him
- Made plans to head to Keygarde to take care of Lady Duprois's problem
  - Head to Monstera afterwards
