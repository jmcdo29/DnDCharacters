- Zerrias talks with Kai
  - tells her he's an Orchid
- Zerrias told me to try to stop being so nosy
  - Also understood why I was
- Why the fuck is it so cold this morning?
  - What the fuck?
  - Why is it so cold?
  - It's getting colder as we head to Keygarde
- Made it to the Silvitaris River
  - Can't melt the ice on the bridge, it re-freezes too fast
  - Somehow we got the horses across the bridge
  - Kai saw a "person" in the river to the East
  - Azreal and I could see it too
    - I wanna know who this person is
      - But he's probably too far away
- Zerrias sweeps at my legs
  - Licianna picks me up and carries me back to the gods damned cart
  - Zerrias is an asshole
- Camping in Vistem
  - Still a ways to Shadewick
  - A bear came to visit us in the night
    - It didn't want the rations I threw it
      - Maybe it didn't see?
- Zerrias's parents names
  - Karris
  - Calliope
- Zerrias and I talked about family
- Azreal and Zerrias met Noah? last night
  - Child Noah with damaged orb
    - Freaked out at the mention of Ophiucus
- Maxam had a dream about a voice feeling lost
  - Unsure of what's going on and hurting
- Best bet to find Noah would be the heart of the storm
- Noah is probably at Lifewell Loch
- It would be a better idea to get the kids to Keygarde than Shadewick
  - Takes longer, but further from the Loch and the storm
- Mentioned that I own a residence in Keygarde
