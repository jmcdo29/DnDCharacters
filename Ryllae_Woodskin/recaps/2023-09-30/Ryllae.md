- Zerrias's gem flashed as he seemed to lean in to someone
  - I wonder if this has happened before
- told the kids about the vichor crystals
- Zerrias seemed a bit concerned
- Zerrias and Licianna took first watch
- Talked with Kai about my proposition
  - Turns out she can't read
  - Kai mentioned a wolf spoke to her after they had been running away
    - Turn towards the northeast to head towards Monstera
- Informed Kai about folk lore of Unteris
  - The champions
  - and that Noah's orb is close by?
- Kai is gonna take me up on the offer to work at the Wood's Eye
  - Need to get Quilgon to teach Kai and the kids to read and write
- Wolf of Thirio showed up again
  - Wow, second interaction in a week
  - had a pouch of 15 gold and 50 silver
    - Had a note that read: "little elf, leave Syn to me, you'll meet him soon"
    - I'll hand that to Kai in the morning
- Licianna prefers being bitten to Zerrias using shadows or me talking
- Zerrias found out the vichor gems are "sentient"
  - He hallucinated Simon yesterday when the gem glowed
  - Tried to talk to Simon again and found out the gem is using Simon's vision
  - Vichor comes from Arvita
    - Arvita split into three
    - part of sadness
      - we've met
    - part in Carcer
      - yay
    - part unknown
  - Vichor physically spoke to Zerrias
    - Has not happened to me
  - Gem provides "comfort" when using its powers
  - gems existence is to punish "us"
    - Zerrias vaguely gestures to everything
  - Arvita wanted to inflict the pain she felt from Ophiucus's removal to the world
    - to everything the devas/angels protected
- Zerrias had a very hard cry away from breakfast
- Gave a quick rundown of Ophiucus's probable feelings
  - Kids are hopeful that at least one of the angels aren't bad
- Azreal's brother is Suavi
- Licianna's father is an angel
  - I knew we were traveling with demigods but seriously??
- Got Zerrias food for the road and headed off to Keygarde
