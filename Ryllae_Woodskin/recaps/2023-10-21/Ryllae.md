- Find another crystal down another hallway
  - surrounded by spinning ice block things
  - Zerrias grabbed it with a spectral hand
- Each crystal we pick up cracks the barriers even more
- Fell through the floor!
  - Entered another battlefield with several more reptile things
  - They seem to be ignoring us and going after just Noah
    - My arrow also landed on the ground after hitting one of these things
- Note to self: do not piss of Noah
- Noah fell a bit after the battle, but got back up and kept going
  - Dude seems to be pushing himself like crazy in these memories
- Made it to the center of the cavern
  - Clear crystal
    - adult, male in the middle
      - white hair
      - mid 30s?
      - blue eyes
      - possibly Noah as an adult?
      - Not moving, frozen in place
      - Arms wrapped around legs pressed against chest
  - Can see The Silver Diamond, Noah's orb, in front of him
  - Zerrias went to put a hand up against the crystal
    - Ophiucus actually showed up next to him
      - Holy fuck we can actually see him??
- transported again to another memory
  - cracked ice, black snow, Black Ice Lake
  - WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS THAT?
  - IS THAT A DRAGON??
    - WHY IS THERE A FUCKING DRAGON?
    - WHAT IS THAT BLACK GOO?
    - **OH MY FUCKING GOD THAT HURTS**
    - It can actually fly too! Those wings aren't just for show
    - Holy fuck, Noah froze the lake
      - WAIT THAT'S WHAT'S FROZEN??
      - Fuck.
- Noah is actually in front of us
  - Like, as an adult, fully grown
  - He has more control over his power than when he was younger
- Noah revoked? the snow from his orb
  - he knows Gelum is renamed to Frosdain
- our vichor gems do not seem related to the dragon, thank the gods
- Turns out Tricen's region was destroyed
  - it's now where the Vitoak resides
- the champion's weapons were made for each of them specifically
  - Noah ignored my question about who made them
    - rude
- camp by the loch for the night
  - head to Keygarde in the morning
