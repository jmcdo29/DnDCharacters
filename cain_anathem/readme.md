## The Past

Cain lost his parents at a young age due to a rogue demon attack while traveling. Being left in the wilds, Cain picked up his father's bow and learned the lay of the lands, and learned to his best how to survive. After a few months of gathering berries, herbs, and whatever other scraps he could,along with practicing with the bow, he started hunting game like rabbit and fox.

Cain grew up in the wilds for the most part, only making his way into town to sell wares such as pelts and meats to tanners and butchers. He can't remember what his parents called him while they were alive, but he does remember scholars and some townsfolk whispering "Canis Anathema" as he walked through the town. It was after hearing these words that he took on "Cain Anathem" as his name; however, he still gives his moniker of "Padfoot".

He still makes his way into town every few weeks, but normally Cain can be found in the surrounding woodlands, like The Cloackwood or the Wood of Sharp Teeth, or camping along with River Chionthar. 

Growing up in the wilds has kept Cain in great shape, he wears a light cloak and loose pants to allow for easy movement through the trees while stalking his prey. The cloak is usually dirt brown, but it does get cleaned occasionally and set back to it's grey state; the pants are normally a dark brown, and so long as weather permits, he chooses not to wear shoes.
